# File-Zipper
A DSA project based on HUFFMAN-ENCODING
There was a game like GTA Vice City where we used to compress and write into CDs and DVDs
At that time, there were no pen drives, so these applications were more useful.
We can also build the file zipper software using the greedy Huffman encoder.
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that implements the greedy technique.
This algorithm is based on the frequency of the character appearing in a file.
The Huffman algorithm will accept the InputFile, encode it to a Huffman-coded file, and store it. The user can decode it into an original file if they need to
